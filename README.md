eMark Wireless multimeter is an open-source project, aimed towards building a cheap wireless multimeter device for hobbyists and enthusiasts. This project is a part of Next Tech's Winter of Code, and all the hardware designed will be openly accessible to the public in the form of schematics and gerber files.

## NTWoC Guidelines for this project

Anyone can choose to participate in NTWoC from SRM. so follow this guide to get a chance to collaborate. It is free, it is open and everyone gets a fair chance.

### Abstract

eMark Wireless Multimeter is a device which can measure voltage and current values, similar to a regular multimeter, but it is wireless. It is supposed to be cheap and accessible to all, and the voltage and current values, along with power and other values can be directly read/calculated by a handheld device (Mobile Phones/Tablet/Laptops). The the connection can be created using bluetooth. This needs to be accurate, cheap and should have features which support its build costs and quality.
